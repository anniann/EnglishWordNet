# EnglishWordNet

Creates a lexical database of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs which are then grouped into *synsets*.
Each element in a synset is connected to all other elements through conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.
In `EWordNet.java`, `SAP.java`, and `Outcast.java`, I provide a solution to the problem as specified by `Princeton's Coursera Specification:` https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet/specification.php
